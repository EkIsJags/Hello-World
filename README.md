# Hello Teacher
## This is my **first** Github program
This Hello world repository is for my univirsitie individual assignment. 
I am a student at belgium campus, i absolutly love this univirsity even tho it is moving to a different campus next year. But its not the ocation that makes a univirsity a univirisity, but the staff and alll the people attending the private institution.
my favourite subjects are mainly   1. Mat181/mat282
                                   2. PRG182/281
                                   3. DBD181/281
I heard github is used in the real life world so i am very excited to do a little real life work for one of our assignmentsðŸ˜„
