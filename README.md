# Hello Teacher
## This is my **first** Github program
This Hello world repository is for my univirsitie individual assignment. 
I am a student at belgium campus, i absolutly love this univirsity even tho it is moving to a different campus next year. But its not the ocation that makes a univirsity a univirisity, but the staff and alll the people attending the private institution.
my favourite subjects are mainly: <br>   1. Mat181/mat282 
                                 <br>    2. PRG182/281
                                  <br>   3. DBD181/281 <br>

I heard github is used in the real life world so i am very excited to do a little real life work for one of our assignmentsðŸ˜„

### i have 4 jobs to build up my CV for one day when i get a real job.
- I do bookkeaping for IUM and My moms business on a monthy bases
- I do private tutoring for some people.
- I also tend to help with advertising for a extra class business
